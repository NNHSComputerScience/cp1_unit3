# Intro to for loops notes - counting with the range() function 

# Counting with while loops:
# CHALLENGE: Print 'Hello, world.' 10 times using a while loop

# FOR LOOP - 

# For Loop pseudocode:
 
# Print "Hello, world." 10 times using a for loop
input('\nPrint "Hello, world." 10 times... Press enter to begin.')

# Display numbers 1-10 using a for loop
input("\nPrinting 1 - 10... Press enter to begin.")

# range() function:

#   Display numbers 1-20
input("\nPrinting 1 - 20... Press enter to begin.")
 
# Controlling range() in more detail
#   Count 10-20, by 2's
input("\nPrinting 10 - 20, by 2's... Press enter to begin.")
 
# Practice Challenges:
#   Increment challenge:  Count by 3’s from 3-99, inclusive
input("\nCount by 3’s from 3-99, inclusive... Press enter to begin.")

#   Counting Down Challenge: Count down by 2’s from 10 to -10, inclusive
input("\nCount down by 2’s from 10 to -10, inclusive... Press enter to begin.")

# Application Challenges: Use the range function and for loops to solve each prompt.

# Bug Collector Program -
#   A bug collector collects bugs every day for 7 days. Write a program that
#   keeps a running total of the number of bugs collected during the 7 days.
#   The loop should ask for the number of bugs collected for each day,
#   and when the loop is finished, the program should display the total
#   number of bugs collected. Can you get the day number to display each day?
input("\nBug Collector... Press enter to begin.")
 
# Calories Burned Program -
#   Running on a treadmill you burn 3.9 calories per minute.
#   Write a program that uses a loop to display the number of
#   calories burned after 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes.
#   Display the number of minutes without hard-coding them.
input("\nCalories Burned... Press enter to begin.")
 

# Pennies For Pay Program -
#   Write a program that calculates the amount of money a person would
#   earn over a period of time if their salary is one penny the first day,
#   two pennies the second day, and continues to double each day.
#   The program should ask the user for the number of days worked.
#   Display a table showing what the salary was for each day,
#   and then show the total pay at the end of the period.
input("\nPennies For Pay... Press enter to begin.")
