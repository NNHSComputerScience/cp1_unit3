#   indexing a sequence

import turtle

# INDEX VALUE - selects an item from a sequence, such as a character from a string, or an element from a tuple.
#   use square bracket [] to select an item by index value

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) refresher 
#   OBJECT - a software model that bundles data and behavior together; useful for modeling real-world objects, like turtles!
#   METHOD - behaviors, or actions, of a software object
#       RECALL: Think of and write down below one example of an object in Alice. 
#               Write down two examples of methods for this object.
#       e.g. in Alice a <       > was an object and its methods included <          >
#       e.g. in Python a <      > is an object and its methods include <            >

# create Leonardo

# I didn't write the code for a Turtle. How do I know how to use it?


# create Michelangelo


# INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE: create Raphael & Donatello and draw 2 more squares
#   create Raphael
#   create Donatello


# moving a turtle


# PARTNER CHALLENGE: use a for loop to draw a square with Leo
