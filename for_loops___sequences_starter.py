# For Loops and Sequences Notes

# SEQUENCE = An ordered list of elements, like a string or range.

# ELEMENT = A single item in a sequence.

# ITERATE = To step through a sequence, in order, and one element at a time.

# FOR LOOP = Iterates through a sequence, and executes the loop body for each element in the sequence.

# Often i is used as the looping variable (convention used by many programmers, originating from mathematics)

# CHALLENGE: Secret Message - Ask the user for a message and the display it with each letter displayed twice.
#       e.g. if the message is "great", the output is "ggrreeaatt"
message = input("\nPlease enter a message: ")


# Quick Question: What would display?


# ANSWER: 

# The built-in len() function


# CHALLENGE: Save your first and last name as a string, and then display
#   how many letters are in your full name. What did you learn?


#ANSWER: 

# "in" and "not in" operators 


# CHALLENGE: Password
#       Ask the user for a password. It must be at least 6 characters long,
#       and it must contain a '!' or a '$' sign. If they give a valid password
#       display "Valid Password", otherwise display "Invalid Password".
print("\nPlease enter a password that's >6 characters long and contains a '!' or '$'.")
password = input("What is your password: ")


# Adv. CHALLENGE: Can you use a while loop to keep asking for the password
#       until the user enters it in the correct format?
print("\nPlease enter a password that's >6 characters long and contains a '!' or '$'.")
password = input("What is your password: ")


# type TUPLE: a type of immutable sequence, like a string or range, but can contain ANY type of element.


# printing a tuple


# printing one at a time


# finding one to print

    
# CHALLENGE: search both tuples to find name(s) that are in both


# The tuple() function 
#   Converts any sequence to type tuple.


input("\nPress enter to exit.")
